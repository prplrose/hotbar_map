# Hotbar Map
Client side mod that renders maps in the hotbar. Mod inspired by [Docm77's Hermitcraft episode](https://youtu.be/6kgrJpCa3PE?si=H_aYi4YQjaVXrKJT) in which he creates map arts for his poker minigame.

This mod aims to bring quality of life and make diffirentiating maps in hotbar easier.

As seen on attached screenshots the map is only rendered in hotbar so it doesn't give unfair advantage and doesnt allow to peek at other playeres maps. Map still needs to be in hand to be updated.
